* Authorization description
The OAuth credientials from twitter are grabbed via the environment variables. These are then added to the java command line via the flag -Dtwitter4j.oauth which sets the consumer and accessToken key and secret.

* Code description
Authentication.scala contains the object which sets the OAuth credientials which are provided through the flag -Dtwitter4j.oauth. Listener.scala contains the class which allows us to print the text of the tweet through the status. StreamingApp.scala contains the class which creates a twitter stream by getting an instance through the TwitterStreamFactory. This stream allows us to get tweets, but in order to do anything with them, we have to register a listener to it. This is what's done in the BaseStreamer so the text from the tweet can be found. 
There is an abstract class called FilteredStreamer which extends BaseStreamer. This class allows you to filter tweets based on arguments passed on the command line. There are also objects which extend the FilteredStreamer like IdStreamer, TermStreamer, and LocationStreamer. These are mixin compostions of the FilteredStreamer class and the traits from Query.scala. In Query.scala, the trait Filterable sets up the base trait for each of the mixins from StreamingApp.scala, each which filter differently based on either location, terms, or id. The QueryBuilder object is designed to setup different FilterQuery objects for IdFilter, TermFilter, and LocationFilter which is the return value of the function defiend in these traits.

* What you did to isEnglish
I took your advice and first modified the SimpleTokenizer to remove non-word items like hashtags and mentions. Then I used the English class in LanguageUtil.scala to get the English wordset. Once I had that, I created a regex to match for a word in the wordset. This was done outside isEnglish() since it needs to be initialized only once. Inside isEnglish(), I used the SimpleTokenizer to get the word tokens from the tweet. For each token, I determine if it exists in the wordset. If it does, I simply increment my counter. Once I've iterated through every token, I check if the count divided by the total number of tokens is greater than 50%. If true, the tweet is considered English, otherwise it's labeled as "other".

I did not take into consideration hashtags as tokens. Maybe that would have helped to improve my accuracy by splitting the hashtag into tokens between captialze letters.

~: RT @caitybabyxo: I want you

I think the labels are correct except for maybe the @iLifeQuotess tweet with the word "horror". That seems like it should have been negative rather than neutral. Also in the last tweet, "I want you" seems like a positive sentiment? It could be viewed as creepy, too. Increasing the wordset for positive and negative words would help. Also, taking context into consideration would be beneifical, but I have no idea how to implement that.
