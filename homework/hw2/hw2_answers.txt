I got 16 as the count for "Mr. Twain"

Part (e)

I think the most common problem I saw with my regex was "Rev. Mr" or "Rev. Dr" as being consider a match. This is because in my regex, I am looking for either a "title. first_name", "title. first_name", or "title. first_name MI. last_name". This particular pattern was matching with my first case. I could have added a constraint to handle these types of names, but I wanted to focus on problem 5 instead.

Problem 5


Part (b)
There are two articles named "FEDERALIST No. 70", and since we are doing split on the text, the string prior to " FEDERALIST. No. 1" counts as an element in the array.
